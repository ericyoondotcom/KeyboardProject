Generally depicted as a white horse head facing left with a pink or purple mane and a yellow or rainbow-colored horn.
In addition to the mythical unicorn, may be used to convey whimsy, fantasy, uniqueness, specialness, peace, and love. Often used for various content related to the LGBTQ community, thanks in part to its rainbow colors on many platforms. Also often used in association with “unicorn” startups. Sometimes used as a rainbow or holographic accent color.
Vendors implement the emoji with the same or similar design as 🐴 Horse Face, but with colorful hair and a horn.
Available as an Apple Animoji.
